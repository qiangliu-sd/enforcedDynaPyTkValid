### Advanced Tkinter features:
1. Enforced validating of Entry widgets.
2. Dynamic validating of bounds (or ranges) of user inputs via Entry widgets.
3. JSON based dynamic GUI with tooltips and validations.

One can download all the source files and run **TkinterGui.py** to test the App.

For design details, read [Enforced Dynamic Tkinter-Validating with JSON](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/18390390/readme.pdf)

_This is a scaled-down version of my GUI for convertible bonds (CB) pricing, which has around 100 Tkinter widgets (and calls the CB-pricing algorithm implemented in C++).<br>
[Contact me](https://www.linkedin.com/in/qiangliu427/) if you are interested in the CB-pricing suite._
