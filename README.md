### Advanced Tkinter features:
1. Bulletproof enforced validating of Entry widgets.
2. Dynamic validating of ranges (or bounds) of user inputs via Entry widgets.
3. JSON based dynamic GUI with tooltips and validations.

One can download all the source files and run **TkinterGui.py** to test the App.

For design details, read [Enforced Dynamic-Range Tkinter-Validating with JSON](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/18462772/readme.pdf).


_This is a scaled-down version of my GUI for convertible bonds_ (CB) _pricing, which has around 100 Tkinter widgets_ (_and calls the CB-pricing algorithm implemented in C++_).<br>
